# Content

The folder containing the blog's generated content.

All the blog content is saved in my Notion workspace; this folder contains the generated versions of the content (which is fetched using the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com)).

## `metadata/`

A folder containing a JSON file for each content type with metadata about the content (e.g. the names of all the files inside the content folder).
