However, patience is definitely a virtue I'll have to master if I want to be successful with timeblocking.\n\n```plain text\n7:30          | Woke up\n7:30 - 7:55   | Maintenance stuff on laptop\n7:55 - 8:05   | Continue making timeblock\n8:05 - 8:35   | Morning Routine\n8:35 - 9:10   | Do a paper 3 and mark it\n9:10 - 10:30  | Fix discord-email-tunnel\n10:30 - 10:40 | Reschedule timeblock\n10:40 - 11:10 | Practice math paper 3\n11:10 - 18:30 | Try to fix my MacBook software and upgrade things\n18:30 - 19:15 | Practice math paper 3\n19:15 - 21:00 | Explore Notion API w/ backlog\n21:00 - 22:00 | Create English Literary Features checklist\n22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n### v7\n\nGave up trying to follow today's timeblock :/\n\n```plain text\n7:30          | Woke up\n7:30 - 7:55   | Maintenance stuff on laptop\n7:55 - 8:05   | Continue making timeblock\n8:05 - 8:35   | Morning Routine\n8:35 - 9:10   | Do a paper 3 and mark it\n9:10 - 10:30  | Fix discord-email-tunnel\n10:30 - 10:40 | Reschedule timeblock\n10:40 - 11:10 | Practice math paper 3\n11:10 - 18:30 | Try to fix my MacBook software and upgrade things\n18:30 - 19:15 | Practice math paper 3\n19:15 - 22:15 | Fix blog\n22:15 - 23:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```plain text\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```plain text\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n"}
