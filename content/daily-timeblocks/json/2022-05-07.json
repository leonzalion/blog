I'm not sure if it has to do with my sleep schedule, but I think it's worth experimenting to falling asleep later in the day.\n\nI'm going to start experimenting with a new sleep schedule today. I'll start keeping a sleep \"journal\" (which is probably just going to be voice memos on my Apple Watch) so I can track how the experiment goes. I'll review the outcome of the experiment after 2 weeks.\n\nIt looks like 7 hours should be enough sleep for me now that I'm an \"adult\", so I'll try getting a consistent 7 hours of sleep every day. I'll probably be in bed at 12:30 AM, and take ~15 minutes to fall asleep, so I'll probably be asleep by 12:45 AM. Based on [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/wake/), I should be waking up at 8:15 AM to optimize for sleep cycles, which gives me about 7.5 hours of sleep a day.\n\n(There will be some exceptions during this experiment for waking up in time for exams, where I'll have to wake up at around 7:30 AM, but after that, I'll be free to wake up at any time I choose since I'll be taking a gap year)\n\n### Update\n\nJust read [this article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/16/17233860/night-owl-chronobiology-sleeping-late-health-risk) about sleep, and it says going to sleep late (i.e. past midnight) isn't the best idea. However, I won't be able to change the gymnastics gym date/time, so the best I can do is to make Friday an exception.\n\nThus, I'm changing my experiment to head to bed at 11:15 PM each night (giving myself 15 mins to fall asleep), so I'll be sleeping from 11:30 PM to 7:00 PM.\n"}
