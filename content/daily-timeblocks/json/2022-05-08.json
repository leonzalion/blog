I'll probably invest time in creating a markdown-it playground where I can input markdown and then take a look at the syntax tree that gets parsed (it doesn't help that the variables are cryptically named either).\n\n### v3 (post)\n\n```plain text\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 10:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n10:30 - 13:50 | Family trip outside\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 16:00 | Nap\n16:00 - 17:00 | Finish blog scripts\n17:00 - 23:00 | Running some errands and doing stuff with family\n23:00 - 23:15 | Email\n23:15         | Sleep (need to sleep on time for exams)\n```\n\n### v4 (post)\n\n```plain text\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 10:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n10:30 - 13:50 | Family trip outside\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 16:00 | Nap\n16:00 - 17:00 | Finish blog scripts\n17:00 - 23:00 | Running some errands and doing stuff with family\n23:00 - 23:15 | Email\n23:15 - 24:00 | Chatted with friends\n24:00         | Sleep\n```\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```plain text\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```plain text\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n"}
