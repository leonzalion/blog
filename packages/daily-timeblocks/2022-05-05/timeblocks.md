### v2

Had literally zero motivation to read the ICS textbook and instead spent the time thinking about my plans after exams...

#### Notes

\* Barely reviewed, checked GitHub for like half the time...
\
I think the main reason it was hard to concentrate is because of the lack of clarity/justification when it comes to "reading the textbook and make notes." My brain isn't convinced that this is an effective method of studying the day of the exam, and there's no way I'm actively reading a significant amount of the textbook in an hour, so my brain tries optimizing for passive learning instead (i.e. skimming the textbook), which is a pretty useless and boring way of studying. I ended up just skimming through Kevin's Anki notes :/

### v3

Reviewed a bit, but felt somewhat tired and decided to nap instead (can't risk feeling tired during the exam).

#### Notes

Distracted from 11:30 - 11:45 browsing random tech websites

### v4

Exam ended later than expected. Also rescheduled genetic algorithms study to after some coding since I'm not exactly in the appetite to do back-to-back ICS.
