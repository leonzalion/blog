### v6

Literally spent the whole day trying to fix `yabai` and upgrade my computer software...in hindsight I should've just let it stay broken (since I don't even use my MacBook that often anyways) but I just have an unreasonably large aversion to leaving things broken for me to deal with later (partially has to do with impatience, I'm not the best at being patient). However, patience is definitely a virtue I'll have to master if I want to be successful with timeblocking.
