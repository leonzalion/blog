## Thoughts

I stuck to my schedule pretty well at the beginning, but when it came to studying for the ICS exam, I found my mind wandering and constantly getting distracted (since it was _really_ boring).

I was listening to Cal Newport's podcast "Deep Questions" during my exercise break, and he mentioned how it was important to sharpen one's ability to concentrate without distraction. Next time, I'll test out the Pomodoro strategy and gradually practice concentration in shorter periods of time.

In the episode, there was also a mention about the daily-weekly-quarterly planning strategy, where you outline your goals for the quarter, and your weekly goals are based off those quarterly goals, and finally your daily timeblock is based off your weekly goals. I plan to adopt this strategy soon so I'll have a big-picture view of my goals and ensure that the daily tasks make progress towards those goals.
