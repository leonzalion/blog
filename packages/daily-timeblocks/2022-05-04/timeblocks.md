### v2

It was extremely difficult for me to motivate myself to continue moving unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion during my second pomodoro; my efficiency was extremely low and I felt really tired. Thus, I'm ending curation early and scheduling the quick walk first.

#### Notes

- Had an extra 30 mins after completing + reviewing + marking the mock Paper 1, so decided to spend 15 mins of that time taking a break and the other 15 mins continuing to curate terms into Notion.

- Sidetracked a bit after Lunch testing out whether various Browsers had a Yabai bug fixed; started Math Paper 1 10 mins late.

### v3

Took a bit longer than expected to mark math exam and replaced exercise break with fixing Cold Turkey emails.

#### Notes

Had to order grad photos and respond to some emails; didn't get around to faithfully fulfilling my evening routine and skipped daily reading. Will 100% get back to it tomorrow or else I'm giving my friends $5 (can't let myself break the habit 2 days in a row).
