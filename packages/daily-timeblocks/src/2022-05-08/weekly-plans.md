## Weekly Plans

- Prepare for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and English Exams (by using Anki to memorize English literary terms and doing a few practice mock papers).
- Get Precommit hosted online on AWS (means I have to set up Kubernetes and all that stuff)
- Get more in shape
- Get a prototype of ProjectPure browser extension working
- Have my "intention workflow" set up so that I don't need to find workarounds (e.g. right now, I'm using Apple Mail as a way to bypass Gmail blocks)
- Finish a rough draft of my Internet Intention article.
