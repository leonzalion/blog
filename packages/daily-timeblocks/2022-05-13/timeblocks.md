#### Notes

- [ ] Add a way to add notes when Notion is offline (i.e. a temporary capture location; I don't want to use voice memos for this since that's only for when I can't type things out); working_memory.txt?
- [ ] You can also create reactive emails on the fly where there is a purpose + version number but no reactive hash (e.g. `euclid1@leonzalion.com`); all these emails are hidden by default (i.e. arrive in the spam folder) but you can enter the purpose + version number to re-show them (and then set an alias from the email to the reactive hash). If email ever gets leaked and spam gets sent through that email, you can then bump the version officially and then add back the reactive hash
