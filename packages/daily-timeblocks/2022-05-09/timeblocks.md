## Timeblocks

### v1

I'm learning that I pretty much always schedule too much tasks for the "Target" section, so I'm going to start adding "buffer time" to account for possible interruptions in my day.

```timeblock
7:00 - 7:30  | Morning Routine
7:30 - 8:00  | Sent some messages to friends
8:00 - 8:20  | Breakfast
8:20 - 8:40  | Create timeblock
8:40 - 11:45 | Math Paper 2 exam; learn about memory palace; reminder to bring deck of cards
11:45 - 12:15 | Blog script for intelligent rebuilds
11:45 - 19:00 | Create BetterChat prototype
19:00 - 21:00 | Handle logistics for Twitch stream
21:00 - 22:00 | Buffer time (work on "reach" goals)
22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine
```

### v2

oops, got sidetracked

```timeblock
7:00 - 7:30  | Morning Routine
7:30 - 8:00  | Sent some messages to friends
8:00 - 8:20  | Breakfast

18:00 - 19:00 | Continue working on BetterChat
19:00 - 21:00 | Handle logistics for Twitch stream
21:00 - 22:00 | Buffer time (work on "reach" goals)
22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine
```
