## Timeblocks

### v1

Reminder to self to track _everything_ with Toggl, even breaks.

```timeblock
7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine
7:30 - 9:00   | Create CLI utility to print double-sided using AppleScript automation (using `applescript-utils`)
9:00 - 9:45   | Create English Literary Terms Anki Flashcards
9:45 - 12:30  | Write an English Paper 1 and 2 and try to mark it/compare it to an exemplar (make sure to find a Paper 1/2 with an exemplar)
12:30 - 12:45 | Lunch
12:45 - 13:30 | Create a `leonzalion-bot` account to automate commits; make old blog entries frozen; make stream box resizable
13:30 - 16:00 | Explore the Notion API and try to find a way to port the backlog over to Notion (because it's way easier to organize it + make some backlog entries private within Notion than with Markdown)
16:00 - 19:00 | Finish basic prototype of BetterChat (all I really need is image support via WebRTC; I'll deal with file support later); update Cold Turkey blocks if finished
19:00 - 21:00 | Fix discord-email-tunnel image embeds on Apple Mail; migrate discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io
21:00 - 22:00 | Buffer time
22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine
```
