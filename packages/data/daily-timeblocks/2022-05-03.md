# Tuesday, May 3, 2022

> **Fun fact:** This date marks my 18th birthday, so it's pretty cool to start this "Daily Timeblock" project on this date. Let's hope this project doesn't end up dead in like a week like some of my other projects...

## Goals

### Target

- [ ] Complete + review 1 Paper 2 ICS exams (3 hours)
- [x] Complete one Paper 1 Math exam (2.5 hours)
- [x] Set up time-tracking/accountability workflow with Toggl (1 hour)
- [ ] Finalize a morning routine + evening routine (30 mins)
- [ ] Start a reading habit by reading for half an hour before bed (30 mins)
- [ ] Polish up AdminControl, compile it, and set it up for real (2 hours)

### Reach

- [ ] Set up a "stream" for my gap year (3 hours)
