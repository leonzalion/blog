## Goals

### Target

- [ ] (old) Polish up AdminControl by finishing the logo and adding the icon to the tray
- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch
- [ ] Prepare for ICS Paper 3
- [x] Sort daily timeblocks on blog by descending order of date
- [x] Deal with ULHacks stuff
- [x] Fix refresh bug on site where refreshing on /daily-timeblocks takes you back to /articles
- [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)
- [ ] Fix Discord Email Tunnel bug with mobile Gmail webview emails
- [ ] Fix discord-email-tunnel error "email parts not found" when replying from apple mail

### Reach

- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock
- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock

### Backlog

- [ ] Move blog deployment onto Netlify because GitHub pages is buggy when it comes to cached content
- [ ] Find a way to not have to rebuild the site every single time I update it
- [ ] Refresh functionality on blog (similar to Vue docs)
- [ ] Create English Literary Terms Anki flashcards
- [ ] Set up Precommit on AWS
- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service
- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects
- [ ] Internet/modern technology contains mix of benefits alongside distractions; spend some time flushing out my ideas (maybe in an article?) about how one of my goals with my software is about bringing intention to modern Internet use; having a clear boundary between benefits and distractions (e.g. AdminControl, pureX, etc.)
- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions "philosophy of technology use"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is
- [ ] Write an article about minimalism
- [ ] Find a better way to organize this backlog (maybe port it into Notion and interact with Notion API to display some of them live on the blog?)
- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation
- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device
- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea
- [ ] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while), and decide whether this is even necessary
- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment
- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it
- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)
  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)
- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)
- [ ] Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io

### Upstream

- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome when Yabai bug is fixed in Chrome Beta

## Timeblocks

### v1

```timeblock
7:30 - 8:00   | Morning Routine
8:00 - 8:15   | Send ULHacks Email
8:15 - 9:00   | Fix refresh blog with blog; Make headers collapsible on blog; sort daily timeblocks by descending order of date; if finished, move onto ICS studying
9:00 - 11:00  | Read through ICS textbook and create notes, 45-15 pomodoro
11:00 - 11:45 | Walk outside, get fresh air & clear mind
11:45 - 12:00 | Prepare for exams; make sure I haven't forgotten anything
12:00 - 15:00 | ICS exam
15:00 - 15:15 | (late) lunch, probably skipping dinner
15:15 - 16:30 | Review genetic algorithms case study by taking notes and re-explaining definitions out loud using Anki until I'm confident
16:30 - 18:00 | Fix Discord Email Tunnel bugs with mobile Gmail and Apple Mail
18:00 - 19:00 | Set up gap year stream logistics for Twitch
19:00 - 21:00 | Polish up AdminControl
21:00 - 22:15 | Evening Routine
```

## Routines

### Morning Routine

```timeblock
7:30        | Wake Up
7:30 - 7:45 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow
7:45 - 8:00 | Breakfast
```

### Evening Routine

```timeblock
21:00 - 21:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day
21:25 - 21:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices
21:30 - 21:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower
21:45 - 22:15 | Reading
22:15         | Bedtime
```

## Plans

### Weekly Plans

- Study for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and use Anki to memorize English literary terms.
- Set up Gap Year Twitch stream for extra accountability.
- Attempt to build a daily routine/habit of practicing Memory Palace.

### Quarterly Plans

#### Blog Updates

- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.
- Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.
- Write an article in May and June.
- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)

#### IB Exams

Continue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.

#### Reactive Emails

Finalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.

Try and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.

#### AdminControl

Publish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.

- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).
- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds

#### Precommit

Finish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.

- Needs a logo
- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration
- Needs more polished UI/UX
- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up

#### Miscellaneous

- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up
- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering
