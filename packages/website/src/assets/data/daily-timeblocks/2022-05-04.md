## Goals

### Target

- [ ] (old) Complete + review one Paper 1 ICS exams (2.5h)
- [ ] (old) Polish up AdminControl by finishing the logo and adding the icon to the tray (1h)
- [ ] Finish curating unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion (2h)
- [ ] Remove all phone alarms and Apple Calendar events
- [ ] Polish up `@leonzalion/configs` and similar projects (1h)
- [ ] Clean Room & Install USB-A charger on nightstand (1h 30m)
- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome (30m)
- [ ] Implement daily-weekly-quarterly planning system (1h)
- [ ] Finish + mark a Paper 1 mock math exam without distractions (2h 15m)

### Reach

- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch (2 hours)

### Backlog

- [ ] (tomorrow) Prepare for ICS Paper 3
- [ ] Fix Discord Email Tunnel bug with mobile Gmail webview emails
- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock
- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock
- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service
- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects
- [ ] Internet/modern technology contains mix of benefits alongside distractions; spend some time flushing out my ideas (maybe in an article?) about how one of my goals with my software is about bringing intention to modern Internet use; having a clear boundary between benefits and distractions (e.g. AdminControl, pureX, etc.)
- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions "philosophy of technology use"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is
- [ ] Write an article about minimalism
- [ ] Find a better way to organize this backlog (maybe port it into Notion and interact with Notion API to display some of them live on the blog?)
- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation
- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device
- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea
- [ ] Sort daily timeblocks on blog by descending order of date
- [ ] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while), and decide whether this is even necessary
- [ ] Fix refresh bug on site where refreshing on /daily-timeblocks takes you back to /articles
- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment
- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it
- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)
  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)
- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)
- [ ] Deal with ULHacks stuff

### v2

It was extremely difficult for me to motivate myself to continue moving unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion during my second pomodoro; my efficiency was extremely low and I felt really tired. Thus, I'm ending curation early and scheduling the quick walk first.

```timeblock
7:30 - 8:00   | Morning Routine
8:00 - 9:25   | Finish curating unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion (using 45-15 pomodoro)

#### Notes

Had an extra 30 mins after completing + reviewing + marking the mock Paper 1, so decided to spend 15 mins of that time taking a break and the other 15 mins continuing to curate terms into Notion.
