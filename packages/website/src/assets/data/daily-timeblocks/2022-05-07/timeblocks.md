#### Notes

Spent 8:00 - 9:00 fixing up `@leonzalion/create-project` since I needed that for ProjectPure.

### v2

Was really tired (since I only received like 7 hours of sleep), so I took a nap.

```timeblock

7:50 - 8:00   | Brush teeth
8:00 - 10:00  | Experiment with Browser Extension + Node Process Web Scraper for ProjectPure
10:00 - 13:00 | Nap
13:00 - 13:30 | Look into adjusting my sleep schedule
13:30 - 15:00 | Finish blog create daily timeblock script; Move blog deployment onto Netlify; make backlog hidden on blog by default

```
