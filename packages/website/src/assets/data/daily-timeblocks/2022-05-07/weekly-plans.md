## Weekly Plans

- Study for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and use Anki to memorize English literary terms.
- Set up Gap Year Twitch stream for extra accountability.
- Attempt to build a daily routine/habit of practicing Memory Palace.

### Reflection

- Did not end up studying too much because I sort of forgot that exams were still a thing (and maybe there was a bit of hyperbolic discounting at play)
- TBD
- I decided on a goal of practicing Memory Palace every Friday during the two 35-min car trips to and from the gym (partially as a way to make productive use of the time)
