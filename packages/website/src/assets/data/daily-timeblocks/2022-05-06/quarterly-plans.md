## Quarterly Plans

### Blog Updates

- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.
- Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.
- Write an article in May and June.
- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)

### IB Exams

Continue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.

### Reactive Emails

Finalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.

Try and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.

### AdminControl

Publish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.

- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).
- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds

### Precommit

Finish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.

- Needs a logo
- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration
- Needs more polished UI/UX
- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up

### Miscellaneous

- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up
- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering
