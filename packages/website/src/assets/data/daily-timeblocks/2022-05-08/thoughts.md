## Thoughts

If I plan on going to the gymnastics gym every week, I'll need to find a better sleep schedule since every Friday, I'll be sleeping at around 12:30.

I've been reading a few [articles about sleep online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/enough-sleep-mental-health-circadian/2021/04/29/b9a2a396-a91e-11eb-bca5-048b2759a489_story.html), and it looks like it's important to wake up at the same time every day, which my weekly trip to the gym is throwing off.

One thing I've been noticing over the past few days is that I've often been waking up in the middle of the night and that I've been taking a bit long to fall asleep; I'm not sure if it has to do with my sleep schedule, but I think it's worth experimenting to falling asleep later in the day.

I'm going to start experimenting with a new sleep schedule today. I'll start keeping a sleep "journal" (which is probably just going to be voice memos on my Apple Watch) so I can track how the experiment goes. I'll review the outcome of the experiment after 2 weeks.

It looks like 7 hours should be enough sleep for me now that I'm an "adult", so I'll try getting a consistent 7 hours of sleep every day. I'll probably be in bed at 12:30 AM, and take ~15 minutes to fall asleep, so I'll probably be asleep by 12:45 AM. Based on [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/wake/), I should be waking up at 8:15 AM to optimize for sleep cycles, which gives me about 7.5 hours of sleep a day.

(There will be some exceptions during this experiment for waking up in time for exams, where I'll have to wake up at around 7:30 AM, but after that, I'll be free to wake up at any time I choose since I'll be taking a gap year)

### Update

Just read [this article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/16/17233860/night-owl-chronobiology-sleeping-late-health-risk) about sleep, and it says going to sleep late (i.e. past midnight) isn't the best idea. However, I won't be able to change the gymnastics gym date/time, so the best I can do is to make Friday an exception.

Thus, I'm changing my experiment to head to bed at 11:15 PM each night (giving myself 15 mins to fall asleep), so I'll be sleeping from 11:30 PM to 7:00 PM.
