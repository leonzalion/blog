## Timeblocks

### v1

```timeblock
7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine
7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)
8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2
10:10 - 11:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog
11:30 - 13:50 | Create InstaChat Prototype
13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends
15:15 - 17:10 | Create InstaChat prototype if not finished ~ move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io
17:10 - 18:30 | Running some errands; pick up some cardboard for backpack-desk-thingy
18:30 - 19:00 | Set deck of cards reminder; Research about Memory Palace (and practice);
19:00 - 21:00 | Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io
21:00 - 22:00 | Set up and start gap year stream on Twitch
22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine
```

- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch
- [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)
- [ ] Do a practice Paper 2 mock exam for Math; review integrals and volume of revolution
- [ ] Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io
- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea (a fun project I have in mind for learning mechanical/computer engineering while still being pretty useful for me)
- [ ] Learn a bit about memory palace
- [ ] Set a reminder to bring a deck of cards every Friday to practice memory palace while on the car ride to gym
- [ ] Create InstaChat prototype (need a better name)
- [ ] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while) - Use Fetch API to dynamically retrieve latest content using the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs since they don't have CORS (also need to place under a production flag in development)
- [ ] Find a way to not have to rebuild the site every single time I update it - create a script in the GitHub pages workflow to skip rebuilding if only markdown in `daily-timeblock/` was changed
- [ ] Get a bunch of cardboard to build backpack-desk thingy prototype
