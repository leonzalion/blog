Next time, I'll test out the Pomodoro strategy and gradually practice concentration in shorter periods of time.\n\nIn the episode, there was also a mention about the daily-weekly-quarterly planning strategy, where you outline your goals for the quarter, and your weekly goals are based off those quarterly goals, and finally your daily timeblock is based off your weekly goals. I plan to adopt this strategy soon so I'll have a big-picture view of my goals and ensure that the daily tasks make progress towards those goals.\n","weekly-plans":"# Tuesday, May 3, 2022\n\n## Weekly Plans\n\n(Not yet implemented)\n","timeblocks":"# Tuesday, May 3, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n> **Fun fact:** This date marks my 18th birthday, so it's pretty cool to start this \"Daily Timeblock\" project on this date.
