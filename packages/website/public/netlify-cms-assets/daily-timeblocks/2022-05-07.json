{"date":"2022-05-07","quarterly-plans":"# Saturday, May 7, 2022\n\n## Quarterly Plans\n\n### Blog Updates\n\n- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.\n- Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.\n- Write an article in May and June.\n- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)\n\n### IB Exams\n\nContinue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.\n\n### Reactive Emails\n\nFinalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n","daily-plans":"# Saturday, May 7, 2022\n\n## Daily Plans\n\n### Target\n\n- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch\n- [x] Move blog deployment onto Netlify because GitHub pages is buggy when it comes to cached content\n- [x] Finish blog create daily timeblock script\n- [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)\n- [x] Explore ways to implement PureApps\n- [ ] Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io\n- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea (a fun project I have in mind for learning mechanical/computer engineering while still being pretty useful for me)\n- [-] Set up Precommit on AWS\n- [x] Polish up AdminControl by finishing the logo and adding the icon to the tray\n- [x] Internet/modern technology contains mix of benefits alongside distractions; spend some time flushing out my ideas (maybe in an article?) about how one of my goals with my software is about bringing intention to modern Internet use; having a clear boundary between benefits and distractions (e.g. AdminControl, ProjectPure, etc.)\n\n### Backlog\n\n- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Find a way to not have to rebuild the site every single time I update it\n- [ ] Refresh functionality on blog (similar to Vue docs)\n- [ ] Create English Literary Terms Anki flashcards\n- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service\n- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects\n- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions \"philosophy of technology use\"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is\n- [ ] Write an article about minimalism\n- [ ] Find a better way to organize this backlog (maybe port it into Notion and interact with Notion API to display some of them live on the blog?)\n- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation\n- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device\n- [ ] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while), and decide whether this is even necessary\n- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment\n- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it\n- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)\n  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)\n- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)\n- [ ] Create InstaChat, a on-the-fly \"chat\" app for posting stuff like links and images in limited \"chat\" places like Google Meet where you can't send images. Use WebRTC\n  - [ ] I'll block Apple Mail once I create InstaChat (hopefully by tomorrow)\n- [ ] Learn a bit about memory palace\n- [ ] Set a reminder to bring a deck of cards every Friday to practice memory palace while on the car ride to gym\n- [ ] Think about how reactive emails would work when using in-person, written emails (make it easy/possible to generate an email on a phone/Apple Watch app? Have backup, extra emails that can be reassigned later on? have a generic, static email for this purpose?)\n- [ ] Finish up vue3-spinners (hard because I need to fix up compile-vue-sfc, which is a significant challenge)\n- [ ] Finish up a very basic browser extension + Node proxy prototype for ProjectPure\n- [ ] Change build script for AdminControl to avoid using pnpm shamefully-hoist (e.g. symlinking/cloning the project folder into a separate directory when running `pnpm run compile`)\n- [ ] Make a wrapper for daily timeblocks that will auto-commit whenever file is updated\n- [ ] Create a \"sort of\" checkbox markdown parser for daily goals on blog\n- [ ] Fix discord-email-tunnel image embeds on Apple Mail\n- [ ] Update Cold Turkey email times based on new Evening Routine\n\n### Upstream\n\n- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome when Yabai bug is fixed in Chrome Beta\n","thoughts":"# Saturday, May 7, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\nIf I plan on going to the gymnastics gym every week, I'll need to find a better sleep schedule since every Friday, I'll be sleeping at around 12:30.\n\nI've been reading a few [articles about sleep online](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/enough-sleep-mental-health-circadian/2021/04/29/b9a2a396-a91e-11eb-bca5-048b2759a489_story.html), and it looks like it's important to wake up at the same time every day, which my weekly trip to the gym is throwing off.\n\nOne thing I've been noticing over the past few days is that I've often been waking up in the middle of the night and that I've been taking a bit long to fall asleep; I'm not sure if it has to do with my sleep schedule, but I think it's worth experimenting to falling asleep later in the day.\n\nI'm going to start experimenting with a new sleep schedule today. I'll start keeping a sleep \"journal\" (which is probably just going to be voice memos on my Apple Watch) so I can track how the experiment goes. I'll review the outcome of the experiment after 2 weeks.\n\nIt looks like 7 hours should be enough sleep for me now that I'm an \"adult\", so I'll try getting a consistent 7 hours of sleep every day. I'll probably be in bed at 12:30 AM, and take ~15 minutes to fall asleep, so I'll probably be asleep by 12:45 AM. Based on [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me/wake/), I should be waking up at 8:15 AM to optimize for sleep cycles, which gives me about 7.5 hours of sleep a day.\n\n(There will be some exceptions during this experiment for waking up in time for exams, where I'll have to wake up at around 7:30 AM, but after that, I'll be free to wake up at any time I choose since I'll be taking a gap year)\n\n### Update\n\nJust read [this article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/16/17233860/night-owl-chronobiology-sleeping-late-health-risk) about sleep, and it says going to sleep late (i.e. past midnight) isn't the best idea. However, I won't be able to change the gymnastics gym date/time, so the best I can do is to make Friday an exception.\n\nThus, I'm changing my experiment to head to bed at 11:15 PM each night (giving myself 15 mins to fall asleep), so I'll be sleeping from 11:30 PM to 7:00 PM.\n","timeblocks":"# Saturday, May 7, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n### v1\n\n```timeblock\n7:30 - 7:50   | Create timeblock (decided to sleep yesterday before finishing evening routine since I was really tired)\n7:50 - 8:00   | Brush teeth\n8:00 - 11:00  | Experiment with Browser Extension + Node Process Web Scraper for ProjectPure\n11:00 - 13:00 | Move discond-email-tunnel-onto fly.io\n13:00 - 15:00 | Finish blog create daily timeblock script;
