{"date":"2022-05-13","daily-plans":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Daily Plans\n\n### Target\n\n- [ ] Flush out/experiment with my portable backpack-desk idea (since I got access to cardboard!), a fun project I have in mind for learning mechanical/computer engineering while still being pretty useful for me\n  - [ ] Also fits nicely with Cal Newport's suggestion of building physical products in the real world (since computer programs unfortunately don't count)\n- [ ] Create a generic `run-bin` script for `@leonzalion/configs` that follows the `./src/bin/x.ts` convention\n- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock (will likely depend on `markdown-it` playground)\n- [ ] Rename `@leonzalion/configs` and add documentation on how to use it\n- [ ] Create `markdown-it` playground\n- [ ] Finish up compile-vue-sfc and vue3-spinners (now that I've found a decent way of implementing compile-vue-sfc)\n- [ ] Reply to Pulley email\n- [ ] Fix 404 error on Netlify (I believe this is pretty involved since I'll have to deploy Netlify on a separate branch in order to maintain compatibility with Netlify CMS; investigate it)\n\n### Backlog\n\n#### Prioritized\n\n- [ ] Consider setting a deadline for all my small, side-projects (Precommit will be my main project once exams are over). Make sure I don't get sucked into the trap of working on a billion small projects instead of one big project and taking the big project as far as possible (set a minimum limit to how much I must work on the big project every day). But, I do want to finish all my productivity utilities for my productivity workflow that will support me throughout the gap year (AdminControl, ProjectPure, etc.)\n- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock\n  - [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)\n- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation\n\n#### Backburner\n\n- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service\n- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects\n- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions \"philosophy of technology use\"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is\n- [ ] Write an article about minimalism\n- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device\n- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment\n- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it\n- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)\n  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)\n- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)\n- [ ] Think about how reactive emails would work when using in-person, written emails (make it easy/possible to generate an email on a phone/Apple Watch app? Have backup, extra emails that can be reassigned later on? have a generic, static email for this purpose?)\n- [ ] Finish up a very basic browser extension + Node proxy prototype for ProjectPure\n- [ ] Change build script for AdminControl to avoid using pnpm shamefully-hoist (e.g. symlinking/cloning the project folder into a separate directory when running `pnpm run compile`)\n- [ ] Make a wrapper for daily timeblocks that will auto-commit whenever file is updated\n- [ ] Create a \"sort of\" checkbox markdown parser for daily goals on blog\n- [ ] Finish writing \"Internet Intention\" article\n- [ ] Fix blog loading screen when loading article\n- [ ] Specify a standard notation when writing timeblocks (e.g. a ~ b = if finished a, do b)\n- [ ] Make sure AdminControl keeps track of previous screen time passwords somewhere in case it goes wrong\n- [ ] Create some Neovim configs that get me comfortable working in Neovim (e.g. pane shortcuts, etc.)\n- [ ] Compile AdminControl so I can download it on my Mac\n- [ ] Create a website for AdminControl\n- [ ] Make changing screen time passcode toggleable on AdminControl\n- [ ] Fix AdminControl bitwarden integration where it creates a folder and keeps track of changes instead of overwriting\n- [ ] Linter/formatter for Daily Timeblock files?\n- [ ] Create npm helper packages for managing pseudo-monorepos (where some packages of the monorepo are in their own repos), decide whether this is even a good idea or not\n- [ ] Consider learning the streaming API so I can create my own streaming software eventually (without having to depend on heavy OBS and also not worry about mic being unmuted)\n- [ ] Apply to Google Internship\n- [ ] Find better ways to set alarms (maybe a small Google Voice app utility to set a bunch of alarms in quick succession?)\n- [ ] Think about/look into how many people *really* get distracted by social media and the Internet\n- [ ] Incorporate some of the ideas during my conversation with George in my Internet Intention article; there should be friction/a barrier for accessing entertainment online (e.g. paying for entertainment), and things that are productive should be frictionless/free to access\n- [ ] Think about whether I want to be able to record voice memos to append to my blog (e.g. when I'm out and can't write stuff down on my blog, but still would like to be able to dynamically update it instantly? idk)\n- [ ] Buy more scotch tape\n- [ ] Think of whether I want a way to update my timeblock via my phone (app, offline mode?)\n- [ ] Apple Health sleep tracking integration in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Apple Watch App for blog (i.e. displaying daily timeblock on apple watch and/or notifications)\n- [ ] Precommit should have a notification symbol that's not invasive; e.g. facebook turned theirs blue to red to attract more attention, meanwhile github has a blue color that I literally never click on; this should also be the case with Precommit such that you only see new notifications when you are intentionally looking at new notifications and otherwise you should feel free to ignore it\n- [ ] Make print-double-sided faster (and applescript-utils in general)\n- [ ] Fix yabai on MacBook Air\n- [ ] Create a background app utility that always git pulls when connected to Internet/when it detects a change to the remote GitHub repository\n- [ ] Create a way to sort Backlog entries by type/project\n- [ ] DM (Digital Minimalism)'s case study of smugness about not using cell phone while others are using it; describes it as the \"sense of meaning that comes with acting with intention.\" I personally find myself sometimes feeling a bit smug about my unconventional/intentional Internet habits, but I've always associated it with a feeling of \"smugness/superiority\" (which is bad) and haven't really thought of it as a sense coming from acting with intention; I should try to channel those feelings of \"being more intentional/productive with my time/life compared to others\" into something that motivates me to make others more aware of the value of their time/life and not something that makes me feel smug\n- [ ] DM talks about a sense of losing control, \"we're losing our ability to enjoy a nice moment with a frantic urge to document it for a virtual audience\". Make sure that the things which I'm making public (such as this blog) have a clear and valuable benefit of being public (right now, it's about accountability since it's extra motivating knowing that my task lists and timeblocks are online for friends to see, and so me failing a timeblock or failing to get a task done isn't just something I end up sweeping under the rug and forgetting about, but is something that's permenant online, making me more motivated to try and check off my tasks and/or follow through with my timeblocks). But, sometimes for my projects, \"accountability\" isn't necessarily the best approach, and I feel that I'm slowly losing the ability to do things without a feeling of needing to make them public. Maybe I should practice just doing things for the sake of enjoyment and not for the sake of production (I guess this adds a caveat to my whole hypothesis about consumption vs production-oriented activities). For example, the Weekly Vibe is something that I do purely for the enjoyment of it and not so it can be turned into like a podcast or some other \"production.\" I need to really think about the true definition of productivity that goes beyond just \"producing things of value\", maybe there's some aspect of productivity that unintuitively overlaps with pure enjoyment without production? This also entails me revisiting my goal of a \"gap year\" stream; would it be something truly valuable for me or is it just feeding my urge to not lose control and to end up \"documenting my life for a virtual audience\"\n- [ ] Block/set an allowance for GitHub with Cold Turkey because I'm finding myself checking it/browsing it like with social media (honestly, the GitHub Web UI isn't really that necessary for me since I do the vast majority things on the command line, so maybe set an allowance for like 10 mins of GitHub a day (although I do need GitHub for CI; maybe whitelist the `/actions` url?))\n  - [ ] Download and learn how to use the GitHub CLI tool so I need github for basic stuff like creating a new repo\n- [ ] Clean my nightstand; tap lightning charger to nightstand\n- [ ] Look into/research into what a sleep diary is, look into implementing one in my evening (or morning?) routine\n- [ ] Implement Voice Memos integration with Google Home (I need to improve my capture system where I can immediately store new thoughts/ideas on the spot which I want to save for later). Right now, this is my voice memos app on my apple watch, but I don't always have my apple watch on me (e.g. when I'm laying in bed and my apple watch is charging), so maybe establish a 100% uptime method for my capture workflow\n- [ ] Add clear voice memos to my evening routine on my timeblock\n- [ ] Fix double-sided-printing paper order\n- [ ] DM's solitude, state of freedom from input of other minds; reminds me of consumption vs production oriented activities; comsumption-based activities definitely lack solitude (since you're consuming input from other minds), but maybe I have to find a nuance in my production-based argument since solitude/being alone with your own thoughts doesn't necessarily mean \"production\" (unless you count \"valuable thoughts\"), but solitude is definitely something that people should be integrating more into their lives in order to live a better life\n- [ ] In DM's chapter about solitude, mentions iPod is a way to continuously distract yourself from your mind; relates to my hatred for things like the radio that are constantly on and distract you from your thoughts (I should talk about the offputting aspect of music and how it's able to make you complacent about time passing without you really doing anything valuable within that time other than consuming content; this is why I'm skeptical of music in general); maybe write an article outlining my thoughts? (my backlog for articles is getting really unwieldly...)\n- [ ] Gotta get my friends a copy of Digital Minimalism; esp. when it relates to social media use for a friend who's struggling with mental health; DM talks about how constant connection with input from other minds wreaks havoc on our mental health\n- [ ] Think about how I can incorporate solitude into my life, maybe build an app to force me to incorporate it? (oh wait, that's what precommit is for)\n- [ ] Commit to eating healthier (maybe make eating out something that I only do as a reward, like following through with timeblock v1? (which is pretty hard for me)\n- [ ] Send Kevin W copy of digital minimalism where it talks about how people exaggerate how much they need a phone\n- [ ] Schedule time for walking alone every day (without podcasts; I've always been trying to make these walks/leisure time as \"productive\" as possible but never really considered how they're a valuable source of solitude where you're free from input from other minds)\n- [ ] Maybe incorporate DM's advice of writing letters to yourself (doesn't have to be on a consistent basis; but only when I feel like I need some time to reflect on my life, especially during difficult times); share this part with George\n- [ ] I think I've been underestimating the value of \"real\" conversation (vs connection), I think my weekly car ride to the gym with a friend is the perfect time to really indulge in real, face-to-face conversation; rethink my plans to try and use that commute time for something \"productive\" and instead view it as a way to practice in-person social communication with a friend (since that's one of the only opportunities I'll get in the coming year to talk face-to-face with somebody that's not on a video call)\n- [ ] Facebook likes kinda remind me of github stars; maybe consider disabling stars with Refined GitHub\n- [ ] Clearing my capture voice memos honesty becomes really time consuming when I miss a day or two; I *really* need to stick to a consistent habit of clearing it every evening\n- [ ] Think about setting \"office hours\" of my day where people can just call me whenever during that time frame (maybe always joining a Google Meet at a certain time in day?), especially as I plan to batch send discord-email-tunnel messages only during a certain time interval in an attempt to force my friends to communicate with me via video chat and not through instant messaging (my goal is to completely move away from conversations in instant messaging and instead use video chats for back-and-forth conversation). Instant messaging = ok for connection, bad for conversation\n- [ ] in DM, Cal Newport talks about how demanding activities make people more energetic, reminds me about my whole idea of production-oriented activities making people more energetic/lively compared to something like binging Netflix; look into the argument that things that are strenuous are what give us the most value\n- [ ] Dumping all my captures in this backlog is not sustainable; prioritize moving it to Notion where I can better organize it\n- [ ] In DM, digital forms of craft like coding aren't alternatives for physical craft where you prodcudet things in the physical world, with a coding project isn't virtual, to an extent I feel he's right, and maybe I want to change some of my projects (e.g. right now I'm experimenting with a mechanical engineering project; building physical things in the real world), but as somebody who aspires to solve people's problems, I think software dev is more relevant for me since a lot of the problems that I see in my everyday life are problems that are best solved with software; not necessarily problems that are effectively solved with a physical device\n- [ ] incorporate social aspect of CrossFit or Snakes & Lattes into Precommit, some kind of group activity where people can precommit together (somehow, in-person? idk); think about it\n- [ ] My gap year plan of learning entrepreneurship sounds like Scott Young's MIT challenge (although mine will be a lot more unstructured/less concrete); maybe research more into what he did for his MIT challenge or maybe even ask him for advice?\n- [ ] Think about whether adding deadlines to these backlog tasks will make them more wieldly (a lot of them are intentionally vague though (e.g. \"think about it\"), but even those could go under a category for an article idea; times where I'll be deliberately thinking/researching deep into a particular topic where \"thinking\" doesn't become something as vague anymore)\n\n### Upstream\n\n- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome when Yabai bug is fixed in Chrome Beta\n","quarterly-plans":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Quarterly Plans\n\n### Blog Updates\n\n- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.\n- [x] Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.\n- Write an article in May and June.\n- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)\n\n### IB Exams\n\nContinue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.\n\n### Reactive Emails\n\nFinalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n- Flush out an actual schedule for my gap year/entrepreneurship (actual deadlines that I'll have to follow), also detail the exact things I'll do to make sure it's a successful year in terms of the experience I've gained\n","thoughts":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\n(No thoughts.)\n","timeblocks":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```timeblock\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```timeblock\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n","weekly-plans":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Weekly Plans\n\n- Prepare for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and English Exams (by using Anki to memorize English literary terms and doing a few practice mock papers).\n- Get Precommit hosted online on AWS (means I have to set up Kubernetes and all that stuff)\n- Get more in shape\n- Get a prototype of ProjectPure browser extension working\n- Have my \"intention workflow\" set up so that I don't need to find workarounds (e.g. right now, I'm using Apple Mail as a way to bypass Gmail blocks)\n- Finish a rough draft of my Internet Intention article.\n"}
