{"date":"2022-05-13","quarterly-plans":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Quarterly Plans\n\n### Blog Updates\n\n- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.\n- [x] Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.\n- Write an article in May and June.\n- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)\n\n### IB Exams\n\nContinue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.\n\n### Reactive Emails\n\nFinalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n- Flush out an actual schedule for my gap year/entrepreneurship (actual deadlines that I'll have to follow), also detail the exact things I'll do to make sure it's a successful year in terms of the experience I've gained\n","thoughts":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\n(No thoughts.)\n","timeblocks":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n### v1\n\n```timeblock\n8:00          | Wake Up\n8:00 - 11:30  | Unplanned time\n11:30 - 15:00 | English Exam\n15:00 - 16:40 | Trip to UofT (errand)\n16:40 - 17:xx | Creating my timeblock for today and tomorrow (on the way home)\n17:xx - 17:yy | Reply to Pulley email\n17:yy - 19:00 | Notion API integration with blog\n19:00 - 19:50 | Update Reactive Emails specification to include dots\n19:50 - 20:00 | Brush teeth; prepare bed\n20:00 - 20:20 | Travel time; practice memory palace\n20:20 - 21:00 | Travel time; social conversation\n21:00 - 23:00 | Gym\n23:00 - 23:15 | Travel time; solitude?\n23:15         | Bed\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n- [ ] Add a way to add notes when Notion is offline (i.e. a temporary capture location; I don't want to use voice memos for this since that's only for when I can't type things out); working_memory.txt?\n- [ ] You can also create reactive emails on the fly where there is a purpose + version number but no reactive hash (e.g. `euclid1@leonzalion.com`); all these emails are hidden by default (i.e. arrive in the spam folder) but you can enter the purpose + version number to re-show them (and then set an alias from the email to the reactive hash). If email ever gets leaked and spam gets sent through that email, you can then bump the version officially and then add back the reactive hash\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```timeblock\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```timeblock\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n","weekly-plans":"# Friday, May 13, 2022\n\n## Weekly Plans\n\n- Prepare for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and English Exams (by using Anki to memorize English literary terms and doing a few practice mock papers).\n- Get Precommit hosted online on AWS (means I have to set up Kubernetes and all that stuff)\n- Get more in shape\n- Get a prototype of ProjectPure browser extension working\n- Have my \"intention workflow\" set up so that I don't need to find workarounds (e.g. right now, I'm using Apple Mail as a way to bypass Gmail blocks)\n- Finish a rough draft of my Internet Intention article.\n"}
