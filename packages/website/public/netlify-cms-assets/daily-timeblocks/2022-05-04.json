Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n","thoughts":"# Wednesday, May 4, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\nI stuck to my schedule pretty well at the beginning, but when it came to studying for the ICS exam, I found my mind wandering and constantly getting distracted (since it was _really_ boring).\n\nI was listening to Cal Newport's podcast \"Deep Questions\" during my exercise break, and he mentioned how it was important to sharpen one's ability to concentrate without distraction. Next time, I'll test out the Pomodoro strategy and gradually practice concentration in shorter periods of time.\n\nIn the episode, there was also a mention about the daily-weekly-quarterly planning strategy, where you outline your goals for the quarter, and your weekly goals are based off those quarterly goals, and finally your daily timeblock is based off your weekly goals. I plan to adopt this strategy soon so I'll have a big-picture view of my goals and ensure that the daily tasks make progress towards those goals.\n","timeblocks":"# Wednesday, May 4, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n### v1\n\n```timeblock\n7:30 - 8:00   | Morning Routine\n8:00 - 10:00  | Finish curating unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion (using 45-15 pomodoro)\n10:00 - 10:15 | Quick Walk outside break\n10:15 - 12:30 | Complete + review one Paper 1 ICS exam\n12:30 - 13:00 | Lunch; Check Emails\n13:00 - 15:15 | Finish + Mark Paper 1 math exam\n15:15 - 15:45 | Exercise break + Podcast\n15:45 - 16:45 | Polish up AdminControl\n16:45 - 17:30 | Remove alarms; Polish up `@leonzalion/configs`\n17:30 - 17:45 | Dinner\n17:45 - 19:30 | Clean Room\n19:30 - 20:00 | Migrate Browser Configs\n20:00 - 21:00 | Implement daily-weekly-quarterly planning system\n21:00 - 22:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n### v2\n\nIt was extremely difficult for me to motivate myself to continue moving unfamiliar ICS concepts into Notion during my second pomodoro; my efficiency was extremely low and I felt really tired.
