{"date":"2022-05-06","daily-plans":"# Friday, May 6, 2022\n\n## Daily Plans\n\n### Target\n\n- [x] (morning) Prepare for ICS Paper 3\n- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch\n- [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)\n- [ ] Explore ways to implement PureApps\n- [ ] Move blog deployment onto Netlify because GitHub pages is buggy when it comes to cached content\n- [ ] Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io\n- [x] Develop a better way to create new daily timeblock files (manually deleting everything is getting a bit annoying), consider splitting up the daily timeblocks into folders\n\n### Reach\n\n- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea (a fun project I have in mind for learning mechanical/computer engineering while still being pretty useful for me)\n- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock\n\n### Backlog\n\n- [ ] (tomorrow) Set up Precommit on AWS\n- [ ] (tomorrow) Polish up AdminControl by finishing the logo and adding the icon to the tray\n- [ ] Find a way to not have to rebuild the site every single time I update it\n- [ ] Refresh functionality on blog (similar to Vue docs)\n- [ ] Create English Literary Terms Anki flashcards\n- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service\n- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects\n- [ ] Internet/modern technology contains mix of benefits alongside distractions; spend some time flushing out my ideas (maybe in an article?) about how one of my goals with my software is about bringing intention to modern Internet use; having a clear boundary between benefits and distractions (e.g. AdminControl, pureX, etc.)\n- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions \"philosophy of technology use\"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is\n- [ ] Write an article about minimalism\n- [ ] Find a better way to organize this backlog (maybe port it into Notion and interact with Notion API to display some of them live on the blog?)\n- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation\n- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device\n- [ ] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while), and decide whether this is even necessary\n- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment\n- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it\n- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)\n  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)\n- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)\n- [x] Think about learning parkour as one of my Quarterly goals\n- [ ] Create InstaChat, a on-the-fly \"chat\" app for posting stuff like links and images in limited \"chat\" places like Google Meet where you can't send images. Use WebRTC\n\n### Upstream\n\n- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome when Yabai bug is fixed in Chrome Beta\n","thoughts":"# Friday, May 6, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\n(No thoughts.)\n","quarterly-plans":"# Friday, May 6, 2022\n\n## Quarterly Plans\n\n### Blog Updates\n\n- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.\n- Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.\n- Write an article in May and June.\n- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)\n\n### IB Exams\n\nContinue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.\n\n### Reactive Emails\n\nFinalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n","timeblocks":"# Friday, May 6, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n### v1\n\n```timeblock\n7:15 - 7:45   | Morning Routine\n7:45 - 9:00   | Quick Paper 3 Review\n9:00 - 10:00  | Paper 3 Exam\n10:00 - 12:30 | Develop better way to create Daily Timeblock files;
