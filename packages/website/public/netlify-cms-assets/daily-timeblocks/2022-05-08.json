{"date":"2022-05-08","daily-plans":"# Sunday, May 8, 2022\n\n## Daily Plans\n\n### Target\n\n- [ ] Set up & start gap year stream on Twitch\n- [ ] Make backlog hidden on blog by default (or better, make all headers toggleable)\n- [x] Do a practice Paper 2 mock exam for Math; review integrals and volume of revolution\n- [ ] Flush out my portable backpack-desk idea (a fun project I have in mind for learning mechanical/computer engineering while still being pretty useful for me)\n- [ ] Learn a bit about memory palace\n- [ ] Set a reminder to bring a deck of cards every Friday to practice memory palace while on the car ride to gym\n- [ ] Create BetterChat prototype\n- [x] Find more immediate way of updating blog (GitHub pages can take a while) - Use Fetch API to dynamically retrieve latest content using the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs since they don't have CORS (also need to place under a production flag in development)\n- [ ] Find a way to not have to rebuild the site every single time I update it - create a script in the GitHub pages workflow to skip rebuilding if only markdown in `daily-timeblock/` was changed\n- [ ] Get a bunch of cardboard to build backpack-desk thingy prototype\n\n### Reach\n\n- [ ] Update Cold Turkey email times based on new Evening Routine\n- [ ] Move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io\n\n### Backlog\n\n#### Prioritized\n\n- [ ] Create English Literary Terms Anki flashcards\n- [ ] Create BetterChat, a on-the-fly \"chat\" app for posting stuff like links and images in limited \"chat\" places like Google Meet where you can't send images. Use WebRTC\n  - [ ] I'll block Apple Mail once I create BetterChat\n- [ ] Toggl integration in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Web worker refresh thing like Vue docs (since I still have caching issues with Netlify)\n- [ ] Create `markdown-it` playground\n\n#### Distant\n\n- [ ] Diff functionality in Daily Timeblock\n- [ ] Refresh functionality on blog (similar to Vue docs)\n- [ ] Write article about thoughts on the worrying business model which is dependent on time spent on the service rather than value gained from the service\n- [ ] Digital Minimalism talks about social media presenting a falsely overpositive portrayal of people's lives which is discouraging towards others; think about how I can try and avoid that aspect with my projects\n- [ ] Digital minimalism mentions \"philosophy of technology use\"; think about what my philosophy of technology use is\n- [ ] Write an article about minimalism\n- [ ] Find a better way to organize this backlog (maybe port it into Notion and interact with Notion API to display some of them live on the blog?)\n- [ ] Polish up reactive emails to the point where I can challenge myself to try and set up a meeting with Google asking whether it's possible to get better API support for dynamically changing emails instead of having to resort to browser automation\n- [ ] Search for whether there exists a product similar to an AirTag but beeps really loudly whenever it moves out of range of a separate device\n- [ ] Consider buying a smart lock for my room from the outside as part of an experiment\n- [ ] Article about my plan for my gap year (ultralearning with entrepreneurship?) and my productivity experiments (e.g. admin control, daily timeblocking, precommitments) throughout the year to make the most out of it\n- [ ] Think about implementing friction with AdminControl based on time + effort (e.g. Cold Turkey text block) instead of requiring parents (but parents still have a way to provide password in case I need it immediately)\n  - [ ] What about the encryption key stored as a blurry/cryptic message that requires effort to manually enter (e.g. captchas or even using images to represent text; anything that a computer can't do quickly and requires time and effort from my end)\n- [ ] Find a way to take Cornell notes in Notion (hidden answer/explanation column and visible term/question column)\n- [ ] Think about how reactive emails would work when using in-person, written emails (make it easy/possible to generate an email on a phone/Apple Watch app? Have backup, extra emails that can be reassigned later on? have a generic, static email for this purpose?)\n- [ ] Finish up vue3-spinners (hard because I need to fix up compile-vue-sfc, which is a significant challenge)\n- [ ] Finish up a very basic browser extension + Node proxy prototype for ProjectPure\n- [ ] Change build script for AdminControl to avoid using pnpm shamefully-hoist (e.g. symlinking/cloning the project folder into a separate directory when running `pnpm run compile`)\n- [ ] Make a wrapper for daily timeblocks that will auto-commit whenever file is updated\n- [ ] Create a \"sort of\" checkbox markdown parser for daily goals on blog\n- [ ] Fix discord-email-tunnel image embeds on Apple Mail\n- [ ] Finish writing \"Internet Intention\" article\n- [ ] Finish setting up Docker containers for Precommit\n- [ ] Fix blog loading screen when loading article\n- [ ] Specify a standard notation when writing timeblocks (e.g. a ~ b = if finished a, do b)\n- [ ] Make sure AdminControl keeps track of previous screen time passwords somewhere in case it goes wrong\n- [ ] Create some Neovim configs that get me comfortable working in Neovim (e.g. pane shortcuts, etc.)\n- [ ] Create a generic `run-bin` script for `@leonzalion/configs` that follows the `./src/bin/x.ts` convention\n- [ ] Create a generic command that encompasses `lint`, `prettier`, and `typecheck` so I don't need to repeatedly specify it in the scripts of every package.json\n- [ ] Compile AdminControl so I can download it on my Mac\n- [ ] Create a website for AdminControl\n- [ ] Make changing screen time passcode toggleable on AdminControl\n- [ ] Fix AdminControl bitwarden integration where it creates a folder and keeps track of changes instead of overwriting\n- [ ] Create a little CLI utility to print double-sided using AppleScript automation (it will print odd pages, then output instructions on how to insert the paper, and when you're done you press enter in the CLI and it will automatically print the even sides using the saved preset it creates by default, and then it will delete the temporary preset afterwards)\n- [x] Find out what is causing the \"can't read &lt;root&gt;/tsconfig.json file\" eslint error when editing files in VSCode with my new configs setup (fixed: <https://github.com/leonzalion/configs/commit/b112d0bc69554aa37db9d789ce56ea6fb7abd211>)\n\n### Upstream\n\n- [ ] Migrate browser configurations to Google Chrome when Yabai bug is fixed in Chrome Beta\n","quarterly-plans":"# Sunday, May 8, 2022\n\n## Quarterly Plans\n\n### Blog Updates\n\n- Implement Daily Timeblock features like a Toggl integration and a diff command.\n- Create a GitHub bot for automation so I don't pollute my contribution graph with automated commits.\n- Write an article in May and June.\n- Find a more ergonomic/efficient way to create/update daily timeblocks (e.g. custom markdown-it plugin to parse timeblock code blocks, script to create new day)\n\n### IB Exams\n\nContinue to practice for IB exams every day by practicing with past exam papers.\n\n### Reactive Emails\n\nFinalize implementation of reactive emails, create an Electron app helper, and actually implement it on my own emails. Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n","thoughts":"# Sunday, May 8, 2022\n\n## Thoughts\n\n(No thoughts.)\n","timeblocks":"# Sunday, May 8, 2022\n\n## Timeblocks\n\n### v1\n\n```timeblock\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 11:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n11:30 - 13:50 | Create BetterChat Prototype\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 17:10 | Create BetterChat prototype if not finished ~ move discord-email-tunnel onto fly.io\n17:10 - 18:30 | Running some errands; pick up some cardboard for backpack-desk-thingy\n18:30 - 19:00 | Set deck of cards reminder; Research about Memory Palace (and practice)\n19:00 - 21:00 | Weekly Vibe\n21:00 - 22:00 | Set up and start gap year stream on Twitch\n22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n### v2\n\nThere goes my schedule for the day...\n\n```timeblock\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 10:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n10:30 - 13:50 | Family trip outside\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 16:00 | Nap\n16:00 - 17:00 | Finish blog scripts\n17:00 - 18:30 | Running some errands; pick up some cardboard for backpack-desk-thingy\n18:30 - 19:00 | Set deck of cards reminder; Research about Memory Palace (and practice)\n19:00 - 21:00 | Weekly Vibe\n21:00 - 22:00 | Set up and start gap year stream on Twitch\n22:00 - 23:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n`markdown-it` has like _zero_ documentation for writing plugins, and as such it's really difficult for me to write custom plugins for my specific markdown parsing needs for my blog. I'll probably invest time in creating a markdown-it playground where I can input markdown and then take a look at the syntax tree that gets parsed (it doesn't help that the variables are cryptically named either).\n\n### v3 (post)\n\n```timeblock\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 10:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n10:30 - 13:50 | Family trip outside\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 16:00 | Nap\n16:00 - 17:00 | Finish blog scripts\n17:00 - 23:00 | Running some errands and doing stuff with family\n23:00 - 23:15 | Email\n23:15         | Sleep (need to sleep on time for exams)\n```\n\n### v4 (post)\n\n```timeblock\n7:00 - 7:30   | Morning Routine\n7:30 - 8:00   | Review Math by going through integration notes and doing a few practice ones (especially trig integrals)\n8:00 - 10:10  | Finish + mark a mock paper 2\n10:10 - 10:30 | Create blog script; update GitHub workflow; backlog hidden on blog\n10:30 - 13:50 | Family trip outside\n13:50 - 15:15 | Soccer w/ friends\n15:15 - 16:00 | Nap\n16:00 - 17:00 | Finish blog scripts\n17:00 - 23:00 | Running some errands and doing stuff with family\n23:00 - 23:15 | Email\n23:15 - 24:00 | Chatted with friends\n24:00         | Sleep\n```\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```timeblock\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```timeblock\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n","weekly-plans":"# Sunday, May 8, 2022\n\n## Weekly Plans\n\n- Prepare for upcoming Math exams (especially Paper 3) and English Exams (by using Anki to memorize English literary terms and doing a few practice mock papers).\n- Get Precommit hosted online on AWS (means I have to set up Kubernetes and all that stuff)\n- Get more in shape\n- Get a prototype of ProjectPure browser extension working\n- Have my \"intention workflow\" set up so that I don't need to find workarounds (e.g. right now, I'm using Apple Mail as a way to bypass Gmail blocks)\n- Finish a rough draft of my Internet Intention article.\n"}
