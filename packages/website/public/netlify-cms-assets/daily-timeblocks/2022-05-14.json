Also set it up properly on my account and consider creating a custom email plugin (explore Google Apps Script) for emails sent to `contact@leonzalion.com` instead of forwarding it to my deprecated email with an auto-reply.\n\nTry and organize a meeting with Google to discuss the idea and whether or not it's possible for me to get better API support with email routing instead of using sketchy browser automation as I'm currently doing.\n\n### AdminControl\n\nPublish AdminControl (with a website and everything) as a finished app that I can easily install on my laptop.\n\n- Add option for AdminControl to be completely autonomous without needing external accountability partner to use by adding time + effort based friction into retrieving an encryption key (e.g. having to identify 150 photos or something).\n- Consider implementing 2-step encryption where a third-party passcode bypasses one expensive step of decryption so that the time it takes to decrypt goes from unfeasible to like 7-ish so seconds\n\n### Precommit\n\nFinish developing Precommit to the point where I'm comfortable actively using it myself.\n\n- Needs a logo\n- Needs Stripe/auto-payment integration\n- Needs more polished UI/UX\n- Needs to be hosted on AWS via Kubernetes with auto-scaling set up\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Precommit myself to meeting exercise goals once I get a exercise routine set up\n- Learn a bit of Electrical/Mechanical Engineering\n- Learn parkour (as a way to get exercise and as a way to get used to the feeling of stepping outside my comfort zone)\n- Flush out an actual schedule for my gap year/entrepreneurship (actual deadlines that I'll have to follow), also detail the exact things I'll do to make sure it's a successful year in terms of the experience I've gained\n","sol.txt":"var $ = \"CSg\"\n_ = {}\n_[$] = !![] + []\n_[_] = [![]] + [][[]]\n_[0] =\n\t(_[$])[0] +\n\t(!![] +\n\t\t[][\n\t\t\t(![] + [])[0] +\n\t\t\t\t_[_][1 + [0]] +\n\t\t\t\t(![] + [])[2] +\n\t\t\t\t_[$][0] +\n\t\t\t\t_[$][3] +\n\t\t\t\t_[$][1]\n\t\t])[1 + [0]] +\n\t$[1] +\n\t_[$][0] +\n\t_[$][1] +\n\t_[_][1 + [0]] +\n\t([][[]] + [])[1] +\n\t$[2]\n\n_[8] = (_[7] = (_[6] = (_[5] = (_[4] = (_[3] = (_[2] = (_[1] = 9 + 1) * _[1]) * _[1]) * _[1]) * _[1]) * _[1]) * _[1]) * _[1]\n\n_ = ``[\n\t(7 * _[8] + 6 * _[7] + 7 * _[6] + _[4] + 5 * _[3] + 3 * _[2] + 4 * _[1] + 3)[\n\t\t_[0]\n\t](6 * 6) +\n\t\t(5 * _[7] + 9 * _[5] + 8 * _[4] + 6 * _[3] + 8 * _[2] + 2 * _[1] + 7)[_[0]](\n\t\t\t6 * 6\n\t\t)\n][\n\t(7 * _[5] + 3 * _[4] + 5 * _[3] + 7 * _[2] + _[1] + 8)[_[0]](6 * 6) +\n\t\t$[0] +\n\t\t(2 * _[4] + 2 * _[3] + 4 * _[2] + _[1] + 9)[_[0]](6 * 6) +\n\t\t$[0] +\n\t\t(3 * _[4] + _[3] + 5 * _[2] + 8 * _[1] + 6)[_[0]](6 * 6)\n]\n_[1] = 9 + 1\n_[2] = (9 + 1) * _[1]\n\n$ = ``[\n\t\n\t(_[6] + 3 * _[5] + 8 * _[4] + 8 * _[3] + 6 * _[2] + 8 * _[1] + 6)[_[0]](6 * 6)\n][\n\t(5 * _[5] + 3 * _[4] + 7 * _[3] + 3 * _[2] + 8 * _[1] + 5)[_[0]](6 * 6)\n](\n\t_[9](9 * 8) +\n\t\t(6 * _[5] + 8 * _[4] + _[3] + _[2] + 8 * _[1])[_[0]](6 * 6) +\n\t\t_[9](9 * 5 -
