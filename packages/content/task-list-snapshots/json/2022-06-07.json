Make sure that the things which I'm making public (such as this blog) have a clear and valuable benefit of being public (right now, it's about accountability since it's extra motivating knowing that my task lists and timeblocks are online for friends to see, and so me failing a timeblock or failing to get a task done isn't just something I end up sweeping under the rug and forgetting about, but is something that's permenant online, making me more motivated to try and check off my tasks and/or follow through with my timeblocks). But, sometimes for my projects, \"accountability\" isn't necessarily the best approach, and I feel that I'm slowly losing the ability to do things without a feeling of needing to make them public. Maybe I should practice just doing things for the sake of enjoyment and not for the sake of production (I guess this adds a caveat to my whole hypothesis about consumption vs production-oriented activities). For example, the Weekly Vibe is something that I do purely for the enjoyment of it and not so it can be turned into like a podcast or some other \"production.\" I need to really think about the true definition of productivity that goes beyond just \"producing things of value\", maybe there's some aspect of productivity that unintuitively overlaps with pure enjoyment without production? This also entails me revisiting my goal of a \"gap year\" stream; would it be something truly valuable for me or is it just feeding my urge to not lose control and to end up \"documenting my life for a virtual audience”","deadlineNotes":"No deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Create a background app utility that always git pulls when connected to Internet/when it detects a change to the remote GitHub repository","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"DM (Digital Minimalism)'s case study of smugness about not using cell phone while others are using it; describes it as the \"sense of meaning that comes with acting with intention.\" I personally find myself sometimes feeling a bit smug about my unconventional/intentional Internet habits, but I've always associated it with a feeling of \"smugness/superiority\" (which is bad) and haven't really thought of it as a sense coming from acting with intention; I should try to channel those feelings of \"being more intentional/productive with my time/life compared to others\" into something that motivates me to make others more aware of the value of their time/life and not something that makes me feel smug","deadlineNotes":"No deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Make print-double-sided faster (and applescript-utils in general)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Precommit should have a notification symbol that's not invasive; e.g. facebook turned theirs blue to red to attract more attention, meanwhile github has a blue color that I literally never click on; this should also be the case with Precommit such that you only see new notifications when you are intentionally looking at new notifications and otherwise you should feel free to ignore it","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Incorporate some of the ideas during my conversation with George in my Internet Intention article; there should be friction/a barrier for accessing entertainment online (e.g. paying for entertainment), and things that are productive should be frictionless/free to access","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Think about whether I want to be able to record voice memos to append to my blog (e.g. when I'm out and can't write stuff down on my blog, but still would like to be able to dynamically update it instantly? idk)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Apple Watch App for blog (i.e. displaying daily timeblock on apple watch and/or notifications)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Figure out a way to record Desktop audio on MacOS from OBS","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Think about/look into how many people really get distracted by social media and the Internet","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Find better ways to set alarms (maybe a small Google Voice app utility to set a bunch of alarms in quick succession?)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Linter/formatter for Daily Timeblock files?","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Create a website for AdminControl","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Compile AdminControl so I can download it on my Mac","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Consider learning the streaming API so I can create my own streaming software eventually (without having to depend on heavy OBS and also not worry about mic being unmuted)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Create some Neovim configs that get me comfortable working in Neovim (e.g. pane shortcuts, etc.)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Create npm helper packages for managing pseudo-monorepos (where some packages of the monorepo are in their own repos), decide whether this is even a good idea or not (I think it might be because of the ability to work alongside other packages without having to create new releases)","deadlineNotes":"no deadline"},{"completed":false,"description":"Think about how reactive emails would work when using in-person, written emails (make it easy/possible to generate an email on a phone/Apple Watch app?
