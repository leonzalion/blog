Make sure that the things which I'm making public (such as this blog) have a clear and valuable benefit of being public (right now, it's about accountability since it's extra motivating knowing that my task lists and timeblocks are online for friends to see, and so me failing a timeblock or failing to get a task done isn't just something I end up sweeping under the rug and forgetting about, but is something that's permenant online, making me more motivated to try and check off my tasks and/or follow through with my timeblocks). But, sometimes for my projects, \"accountability\" isn't necessarily the best approach, and I feel that I'm slowly losing the ability to do things without a feeling of needing to make them public. Maybe I should practice just doing things for the sake of enjoyment and not for the sake of production (I guess this adds a caveat to my whole hypothesis about consumption vs production-oriented activities). For example, the Weekly Vibe is something that I do purely for the enjoyment of it and not so it can be turned into like a podcast or some other \"production.\" I need to really think about the true definition of productivity that goes beyond just \"producing things of value\", maybe there's some aspect of productivity that unintuitively overlaps with pure enjoyment without production?
