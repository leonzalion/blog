I didn't make a timeblock for today and decided to just tackle the first few items on my todolist without setting a time frame for each.

Some of the things I got done:

- [x] Finish migrating all tasks to Notion with deadlines and labels (will implement the Notion API soon)
- [x] Rename `@leonzalion/configs` and add documentation.
- [x] Finished `vue3-spinners` and `compile-vue-sfc` (this took pretty much the entire day)
