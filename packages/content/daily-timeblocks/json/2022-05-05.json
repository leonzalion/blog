I ended up just skimming through Kevin's Anki notes :/\n\n### v3\n\nReviewed a bit, but felt somewhat tired and decided to nap instead (can't risk feeling tired during the exam).\n\n```plain text\n7:30 - 8:00   | Morning Routine\n8:00 - 8:15   | Send ULHacks Email\n8:15 - 9:00   | Fix refresh blog with blog; Make headers collapsible on blog; sort daily timeblocks by descending order of date; if finished, move onto ICS studying\n9:00 - 10:15  | Spontaneous thinking\n10:15 - 10:30 | Review ICS Notes and Kevin's Anki cards\n10:30 - 11:30 | Nap\n11:30 - 12:00 | Prepare for exams & make sure I haven't forgotten anything; wait outside to get fresh air\n12:00 - 15:00 | ICS exam\n15:00 - 15:15 | (late) lunch, probably skipping dinner\n15:15 - 16:30 | Review genetic algorithms case study by taking notes and re-explaining definitions out loud using Anki until I'm confident\n16:30 - 18:00 | Fix Discord Email Tunnel bugs with mobile Gmail and Apple Mail\n18:00 - 19:00 | Set up gap year stream logistics for Twitch\n19:00 - 21:00 | Polish up AdminControl\n21:00 - 22:15 | Evening Routine\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nDistracted from 11:30 - 11:45 browsing random tech websites\n\n### v4\n\nExam ended later than expected.
