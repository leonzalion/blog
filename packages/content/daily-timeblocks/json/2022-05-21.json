Brush Teeth;\n7:10        | Eat Breakfast (while working on another task)\n```\n\n### Afternoon Routine\n\n```plain text\n13:10 - 13:20 | Solitude walk around the block (time to distance myself from one project and start work on the other) \n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```plain text\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Fill out Sleep Log; Bedtime\n```\n\n## Generic Timeblock\n\nThese entries are intentionally vague (the specifics will be listed in the specific timeblocks above), but the general order of tasks/priority of tasks is outlined in the following generic timeblock:\n\n```plain text\n7:00 - 7:10   | Morning Routine\n7:10 - 13:10  | Dialect work (specific activities listed in specific timeblock above)\n13:10 - 19:10 | Precommit work (specific activities listed in specific timeblock above)\n19:10 - 20:40 | Side projects\n20:40 - 22:00 | Buffer time\n```\n\n### Notes\n\nGoal is to work minimum of 6 hours a day on Dialect, 6 hours a day on Precommit, and then 1 hour a day on side projects. The rest of the time is allocated for free time on other activities (e.g. a family trip, etc.)\n\nI have 700 mins (~12 hours) of free time each week which I must deliberately spend and not exceed. I will deliberately track them each week at the bottom of each Daily Timeblock entry.\n","dateString":"2022-05-21"}
