If email ever gets leaked and spam gets sent through that email, you can then bump the version officially and then add back the reactive hash\n\n## Routines\n\n### Morning Routine\n\n```plain text\n7:00        | Wake Up\n7:00 - 7:15 | Brush Teeth, Make Bed, Place Kindle on Pillow\n7:15 - 7:30 | Breakfast\n```\n\n### Evening Routine\n\n```plain text\n22:00 - 22:25 | Check email; Create timeblock for next day\n22:25 - 22:30 | Clear desk; Plug in devices\n22:30 - 22:45 | Brush teeth; Quick shower\n22:45 - 23:15 | Reading\n23:15         | Bedtime; experiment with playing Weightless\n```\n"}
