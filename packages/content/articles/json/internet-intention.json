{"slug":"internet-intention","title":"Internet Intention","content":"\nOn the Internet, more freedom isn’t always a good thing.\n\nThink about the physical places in which you do work, like a physical classroom or an in-person workplace. In a sense, these places are designed to “limit your freedom.” In classrooms, you aren’t allowed to pull out your phone and start playing video games. In a workplace, you can’t just spontaneously decide to call a friend and chat while you’re supposed to be working.\n\nBut now, think about the virtual equivalents of these settings. In many online classrooms, the teacher often won’t know if you keep your browser muted and start a game of League with your friends. If you work in a remote workplace, there’s very little stopping you from just pulling out your phone and scrolling through social media while you’re supposed to be working.\n\nAs this example illustrates, restrictions on what we can do at certain times are often valuable for us. Without restrictions, we’re vulnerable to becoming distracted from our task at hand and end up doing things we’ll later regret.\n\nIn other words, more freedom can be harmful for us. And the immense amount of freedom the Internet gives us is the single biggest problem I have with it.\n\n# The Problem with the Internet\n\nOne of the Internet’s main selling points is the fact that “everything is just a few clicks away.”\n\nOn YouTube, you could be watching an education video for school. Suddenly, a video in the recommendations section captures your attention, and with a single click, you then find yourself watching through highlights of last night’s soccer game.\n\nOn Twitter, you could be following some people you admire, and reading through some insightful advice that your role models are tweeting. Suddenly, you see a hashtag that piques your interest, and with a single click, you then find yourself fuelled with anger at the “idiots” on Twitter who are posting their controversial opinions about some random topic you had no interest in a few minutes ago.\n\nOn Instagram…well, you get the idea.\n\nSince “everything is just a few clicks away” on the Internet, there are virtually no restrictions when using it. There is very little preventing you from suddenly transitioning from a productive use of these services to a distracting and harmful use of them.\n\nThe worst part is: these companies behind these services have zero incentive to add such restrictions because their business model thrives on your time and attention. The amount of money they earn is proportional to the time you spend on the platform. As such, their motivation isn’t to make sure you gain the most value from their service, but rather that you spend as much of your attention and time as possible using the service. Restrictions would only hurt this business model.\n\n> Be _very_ careful about using services whose profits are proportional to the time you spend on the platform.\n\nTo clarify, I’m not arguing that these social media platforms are always harmful and you should avoid them at all costs. Instead, I’m arguing that the companies behind these platforms are financially motivated to capture as much of your time and attention as possible. They couldn’t care less about making sure you leave each mindless scrolling session of their feed with valuable and productive content that improves your life.\n\nDespite their motivations, there are often valuable uses of these platforms: my friend gains valuable entrepreneurial advice and resources from following investors and entrepreneurs on Twitter; YouTube is an incredible platform which is home to millions of valuable and productive videos (heck, it’s literally the platform that forever changed my life four years ago when I discovered Thomas Frank’s YouTube channel!)\n\nThough, I have to admit, I’m having trouble thinking of a good use case for Instagram and TikTok…\n\nI’m not saying that “unproductive” use of the Internet is bad; I’m arguing that our modern use of the Internet has been increasingly lacking in **intention.** And it’s not your fault; social media platforms have been trying to erode the barrier between intentional use and unintentional use for the last few years because it reaps them enormous profits.\n\nSo, how do we bring back _intention_ into our use of the Internet? \n\n# Solving the Internet’s Biggest Flaw\n\nIf too much freedom is the problem, then the solution should be to limit our freedom, right?\n\nWell, yes, but there’s also a thing as too little freedom; I would advise against permanently cutting off your access to modern digital infrastructure and moving into a shack hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest telephone booth.\n\nBut hey, if that sounds appealing to you, I’m not gonna be the one who stops you ;)\n\nIn a sense, the opposite of freedom is restrictions: to limit your freedom, you add more restrictions. I’m an enormous fan of Cold Turkey Blocker, a desktop app that allows you to block distracting websites like YouTube or Instagram. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this app has probably saved me from wasting a few hundred hours on distracting websites.\n\n> **Fun Fact:** As a computer science geek, I actually found a way to easily bypass Cold Turkey Blocker, and so I had to resort to [building my own app](https://github.com/AdminControl) to prevent me from bypassing it…\n\nIn addition, restrictions aren’t the only way to limit your freedom on the Internet. One of the essential forces behind intention is **friction.**\n\nFriction goes against the idea that everything is accessible within a few clicks. Instead, it deliberately makes some activities harder to do than others.\n\nAn easy way to add friction to your use of the Internet is by logging out of all your social media accounts. If that’s not enough, an effective suggestion by Cal Newport in his book Digital Minimalism is to delete all social media apps on your phone. This way, you can’t just pick it up and start mindlessly browsing at a moment’s notice, but instead have to deliberately log onto your computer to access these services.\n\nIn fact, the way I use Cold Turkey Blocker isn’t actually using stone-hard restrictions. I can always disable my block, but only after I type out 999 random characters exactly as they are displayed, which takes me around 15 minutes (and yes, copy-pasting is disabled). That’s usually enough friction to prevent me from impulsively navigating onto YouTube and unintentionally falling down a YouTube rabbit hole.\n\n…\n\nSo, is that it? Has the Internet’s biggest problem been solved?\n\nWell, in my opinion, not really.\n\nYou see, these services have an enormous monopoly on user-produced content. You’d be hard-pressed to find a YouTube alternative which encourages an intentional use of their platform with a similar amount of valuable and productive videos as YouTube.\n\nDue to their monopoly, it’s difficult to avoid using these platforms as-is with all their attention-grabbers and time-wasters that are displayed alongside the valuable and productive content.\n\nThere are extensions like DFTube which block out the distracting content, but they unfortunately don’t work with apps like Cold Turkey Blocker (since they still need the user to be able to access YouTube), and they’re really easy to disable (thus reducing the amount of friction that prevents an impulsive use of the platform).\n\n> You might be asking yourself, “why don’t you just practice self-control and prevent yourself from getting distracted?” While I do agree that self-control is a skill that needs to be trained, in this case, you’re fighting a David vs. Goliath battle. These services have spent years of research and development designing their platform to be as addictive and attention-grabbing as possible. Whether it’s the gambling-like aspect of refreshing your feed, or the dopamine-rich interactions like follows and likes, these platforms are masters at hacking our innate desires and hijacking our brains to waste our time and attention on these services.  \n>  \n>In addition, in many situations, I become prone to distraction when I’m tired or when my self-control is low. The purpose of apps like Cold Turkey Blocker is to act as a safety net in the moments of low willpower and motivation, preventing me from falling down an Internet rabbit hole an hour before I’m supposed to head to bed.  \n>  \n>Finally, I also believe that willpower is a finite resource. Spending your willpower fighting against getting distracted reduces the willpower you have remaining to motivate yourself to perform more valuable activities. Ironically, knowing that it’s impossible for me to get distracted on YouTube gives me _more_ freedom; I never even think about the possibility getting distracted on YouTube or Twitter anymore simply because _I have no easy way of accessing those services._ By blocking these sites, I don’t even have to use any willpower/self-control to prevent myself from getting distracted.\n\nIf we’re serious about intention, the use of various features on these services should be **opt-in** instead of **opt-out**. You should be the one deciding to intentionally enable the recommendation sidebar beside YouTube videos, or the “Trending” section on Twitter. By approaching your use of the Internet through an opt-in mentality, you maximize the amount of value you gain from the Internet while minimizing the risks of distraction.\n\nUnfortunately, such an app doesn’t exist (at least, not to my knowledge). That’s why I’ve been hoping to create ProjectPure, a solution to the lack of intention on the Internet. I’m hoping to build an open-source app where you can deliberately enable the features you use on these platforms, giving you a filtered view of the content that you believe brings you value, while culling the features that bring you more harm than benefit.\n\n> Sadly, I don’t exactly have a ton of free time on my hands (as I’m working full-time on two startups), so ProjectPure probably won’t be a thing for a while. Although, if you’re eager to help bring ProjectPure to life, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me at [contact@leonzalion.com](mailto:contact@leonzalion.com)! Until then, I highly, highly recommend using an app like [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com) to add friction to your use of the Internet and add more intention into your digital life.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about extracting value out of your digital life, I highly recommend Cal Newport’s book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/). In his book, Cal dives much deeper into being intentional with your use of the Internet and provides much more valuable and actionable advice on extracting maximum value from your time online. (And no, this isn’t sponsored or anything; I just really enjoyed Cal’s book and think that everybody who desires a more intentional relationship with their Internet use should give it a read.)\n\n> I’m always open to feedback on my ideas and writing; if you have any thoughts, whether it’s comments or criticism, please send them over to my email at [contact@leonzalion.com](mailto:contact@leonzalion.com)!\n","datePublished":"2022-05-31","lastEditedDate":"2022-06-01T02:18:00.000Z"}
