{"slug":"solving-procrastination","title":"Solving Procrastination","content":"\nIt’s pretty ironic to start an article titled “Solving Procrastination” with a confession that I procrastinated on writing this article. That is, I decided to start writing it only on the very last day—the day before the deadline enforced by my precommitment to write an article a month which would’ve forced me to give $25 to a friend.\n\nI guess I should ask myself: why did I procrastinate on writing this article? I had the entirely of the month of June to do it, and I only started on the very last day.\n\nFor the first three weeks of June, I pretty much forgot about needing to write an article. I had a bunch of other things planned that were more “urgent” than the article, and I never really felt the need to dedicate a chunk of my timeblock to working on the article since there was so much time remaining.\n\n…until there wasn’t. To be fair, I was going to start writing earlier in the week, but I just had a bunch of other tasks that I wanted to do more, like working on my startup and hanging out with friends.\n\nExcept for today; today, I want to finish writing my article and prioritize it over all my other tasks or otherwise I’ll lose $25.\n\nThe same phenomenon holds true with many other activities we procrastinate on, such as doing homework or studying for a test. We finish our homework at the very last minute because otherwise we’ll get in trouble. We start working on projects at the very last minute because otherwise we’ll get a bad mark.\n\nIn other words, we start doing activities when the consequences of not doing them become motivating enough to force us to get to work.\n\nIn other words, **deadlines** with _consequences_ are what motivate us to work. So it makes sense to conclude that a solution to procrastination would be to create deadlines which motivate us to finish work earlier.\n\nWell, unfortunately, that’s easier said than done. It’s pretty difficult to trick your brain into believing that an assignment is due earlier than it actually is, or that a test is actually tomorrow and not next week.\n\nLuckily, the due date of the assignment or the time of the test isn’t the only “deadline” available. You can also create your own deadlines for specific activities which are due earlier than the “real” deadline, like “finishing the first paragraph of my English essay” or “finish creating flashcards for Section 3.1 in my Physics textbook.”\n\nBut then, the problem is, how do you make sure you respect those deadlines? Setting deadlines is the easy part—sticking to them is the hard part.\n\nThe key to sticking to deadlines is _precommitments_, commitments you make ahead of time to reach a certain goal before a set time or condition or else face a consequence. The consequence could either be the lack of a reward (like “if I finish my homework by tomorrow, I get to go to the movies on Sunday), or a punishment (like “if I don’t finish my blog post by June 30th, I have to give my friends $25).\n\nIn my experience, punishment-based consequences are extremely effective, but in order for them to work, you need _accountability._ In other words, you need people who will make sure you stick to your word when you make your precommitments. This can be your friends, or even your followers (I remember a story from [Thomas Frank](https://thomasjfrank.com), where to force himself to wake up early, he had an automated Tweet that would go up at 6:10AM each morning telling his Twitter followers that he’d give the first 5 people to reply $5 via PayPal, and he had to cancel the Tweet every morning before then).\n\nIn addition to a specific deadline and motivating punishment, you also need a specific goal, or else it’s easy to weasel yourself out of a punishment. For example, a precommitment to “work on your assignment” isn’t going to ensure that you get a lot of work done, but a goal to “finish a 2,000-word rough draft of the essay” will force you to produce 2,000 words of (hopefully) useful content.\n\nThe goal itself is also not enough, but you also need a way to prove that you’ve reached the goal. For an assignment, this could be a photo of the completed work or a shared Google Doc, but for other precommitments like exercising, it could simply be a photo of yourself at the gym near a clock when you go in, and another photo when you go out. When I had a precommitment to wake up early every day, my proof was a screenshot of the app I used to track my sleep which displayed the date and what time I had waken up at.\n\nFinally, you need a reliable way to send the proof to those holding you accountable, and a reliable way for the punishment to be executed/enforced. Sending the proof could be as simple as sending a photo on the deadline date through direct messages, but enforcing punishment is a bit tricker. With people you know, the motivation to follow through with your punishment would come from preserving your “self-image” as somebody who follows through with their word, but sometimes that isn’t reliable enough, especially when the punishment is large. And many friends are usually nice enough to let a punishment go, which, while it’s a nice gesture, is only weakening the effectiveness of precommitments.\n\nI’ve recently been experimenting with ways to automate the process of delivering punishments, which is easy for my type of punishments since they’re mostly monetary. For example, with trying to wake up at 7AM in the morning, I used to have a Discord Bot that would automatically send a gift card code in a Discord Server with my friends if I failed to send the screenshot before 7AM.\n\nUnfortunately, not everybody is able to create a program like that to automate punishments, which is why there are apps like Beeminder and stickK out there that allow you to create precommitments with automated consequences. However, with Beeminder, you usually input the proof yourself, so it’s very easy to fake data to prevent yourself from losing money whenever you don’t reach your goal. And with stickK, there’s a ton of steps and friction to creating a precommitment.\n\nI believe precommitments should be used way more often than just for “long-term goals” like losing weight or exercising more. In fact, every item on a todo list worth doing should have some form of a precommitment attached to them, or else you end up with an overflowing todo list with overdue tasks from many months back.\n\nIn addition, not everybody has the financial means to enforce high-stakes monetary-based punishments for precommitments. Luckily, there are other ways to create extremely motivating punishments, especially when they involve a group. I used to use a gamified habit-tracking app, Habitica, which had a feature called “Parties.” You’d create a party with some friends, and you could go on quests together and fight bosses, which damage you if you fail to complete your tasks. But, there’s a catch: if you don’t reach your goals, the boss not only damages _you_, but it also deals damage to _each member of the party._ This was ridiculously motivating (at least, until my friends stopped using the app), since I didn’t want my actions to harm my friends, even if it was just in an RPG.\n\nWhat if we could take this group accountability idea to the next level with real-world consequences? What if there was an app where, if you failed to reach your goals, you _and_ your friends would lose money? (Of course, in this case, you’d need a third-party verifier that isn’t involved in the precommitment punishment.) This could apply to group-based goals, like finishing a homework assignment early, or it could even apply to individual goals, where you could set your goals and your friend could set his, and if either one of you failed your individual goals, both of you would have to give money to some third-party.\n\nThe problem with these types of group-based punishments is that they require a lot of overhead, especially when it comes to enforcing these punishments. If only there was an app to automate this entire process of creating precommitments, enforcing punishments, and sending proof to verifiers…\n\nYou can probably see where I’m going with this :)\n\nI’m currently working on an app called Precommit which makes creating precommitments as easy as creating a task on a todo list. I want to encourage making precommitments the _default_ instead of mere deadlines with no consequences if they’re overdue. I’m still ironing out some of the details (like how punishments will be automated), including exploring non-monetary forms of punishment that can still be enforced (the equivalent of “I’m not allowed to go out/play games/watch a movie until I’ve finished my homework,” but somehow enforced; maybe there’s some way to make an automated script that like cancels a ticket?)\n\nI’m currently developing the app over at https://precommitapp.com, but I’ve been a bit busy over the past few weeks with my other startup Dialect (maybe I should create a precommitment to work on this precommitment app…).\n\nThat being said, you don’t need my app to start making precommitments! If you’re looking for a way to fight procrastination, find a friend to be your accountability partner, come up with a punishment that would motivate you to reach your goals, and give precommitments a try!\n","datePublished":"2022-06-30","lastEditedDate":"2022-07-01T03:17:00.000Z"}
