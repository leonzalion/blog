{"content":"\nHello, world!\n\nI'm Leon, a programmer obsessed with productivity who's currently exploring the world of entrepreneurship. In this blog, I'll be occasionally posting articles about various topics, ideas, and projects.\n\nAs a firm believer in precommitments, I'm committing myself to posting _at least_ one article a month to ensure that this blog doesn't become neglected. If a month goes by without a new article posted on this blog, the first person to send me an email will receive a <span title='A $25 gift card!'>reward</span> :)\n\nI hope you find my articles interesting, and if you ever want to get in touch with me, feel free to contact me at contact@leonzalion.com!\n","dateCreated":"2022-05-02","title":"Introduction"}
