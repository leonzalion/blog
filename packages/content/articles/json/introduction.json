{"slug":"introduction","title":"Introduction","content":"\nHello, world!\n\nI'm Leon, a programmer obsessed with productivity who's currently exploring the world of entrepreneurship. In this blog, I'll be occasionally posting articles about various topics, ideas, and projects.\n\nAs a firm believer in precommitments, I'm committing myself to posting _at least_ one article a month to ensure that this blog doesn't become neglected. If a month goes by without a new article posted on this blog, the first person to send me an email will receive a reward :)\n\nI hope you find my articles interesting, and if you ever want to get in touch with me, feel free to contact me at [contact@leonzalion.com](mailto:contact@leonzalion.com)!\n","datePublished":"2022-05-02","lastEditedDate":"2022-06-01T02:20:00.000Z"}
